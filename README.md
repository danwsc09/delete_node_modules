# Delete node_modules
This is a simple script written in TypeScript to delete all the node_modules of a directory recursively.

```bash
$ cd ts
$ yarn
$ yarn run start
```
You will be prompted for a directory to delete all the node_modules. Type the full path (ex. `/Users/sudoku/code`) and press enter.

Enter full path to delete all node_modules recursively:
